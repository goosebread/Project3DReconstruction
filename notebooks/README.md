# Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks with self-contained demos.

To avoid large diffs, be sure to clear all large outputs (e.g. plots) before committing
notebooks.

You can use [`nbstripout`](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) to strip outputs from
notebooks. If you use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), this repo includes a hook
that will strip all sufficiently larges outputs from notebooks.
